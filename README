Gitweb provides a minimal git web interface, sufficient for most small projects.

Features:
	- Multiple, separate repositories
	- Repository references (HEAD, master, etc.)
	- Supports bare repositories
	- Typically-expensive responses are cached
	- Process restriction with pledge(2) and unveil(2) on OpenBSD (optional)
	- Chroot (optional)
	- HTTPS (optional)

The page layout of gitweb was modeled after stagit (git.codemadness.org/stagit),
although the source code is independent.

Example configuration file (see config.go for full structure):

	{
		"https": true,
		"https_crt": "/path/to/server.crt",
		"https_key": "/path/to/server.key",
		"port": ":8443",
		"repos": [
			{
				"cache_duration": "2h",
				"description": "A repo.",
				"path": "/path/to/local/repo",
				"ref": "master"
			},
			{
				"bare": true,
				"cache_duration": "24h",
				"description": "A repo cloned with --bare.",
				"path": "/path/to/local/repo.git",
				"ref": "master"
			}
		]
	}

Notes for OpenBSD users:

To use gitweb's built-in pledge(2) and unveil(2) restrictions you must customize
the config. To enable OpenBSD restrictions:

	"openbsd": true

By default this unveils repository paths and the HTTPS crt and key paths.
However it will not unveil the path to git nor the dynamic linker! For this
specify "openbsd_unveils" as an array of additional unveils. On OpenBSD 6.5:

	"openbsd_unveils": [
		["/usr/libexec/ld.so", "r"],
		["/usr/lib/", "r"],
		["/usr/local/lib/", "r"],
		["/usr/local/bin/git", "rx"]
	]
